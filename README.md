# Global Situation Dashboard

A real-time open-source intelligence (OSINT), cyber threat monitoring, disaster awareness, network intelligence, space operations, aviation tracking, maritime awareness, and AI-assisted situational awareness platform built with React, Vite, Three.js, React Globe GL, Satellite.js, and Ollama.

The Global Situation Dashboard provides a centralized operational picture of events occurring across multiple intelligence domains. By combining live cyber threat feeds, disaster monitoring systems, space tracking, network intelligence, aviation monitoring, maritime awareness, and a local AI analyst assistant, the platform delivers a single pane of glass for understanding what is happening around the world.

# Why This Project Exists

Information is often fragmented across dozens of websites, dashboards, intelligence feeds, and monitoring platforms.

The goal of this project is to bring together multiple domains of intelligence into one interactive platform where users can quickly understand:

* What is happening right now
* Which threats are most important
* How different events may be related
* What the overall global risk level is
* Which intelligence feeds are healthy and operational
* What actions may require further investigation

The dashboard is designed for:

* Security Operations Centers (SOC)
* Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) enthusiasts
* Cybersecurity professionals
* Students and researchers
* Intelligence analysts
* Disaster monitoring teams
* Aviation and maritime enthusiasts
* Anyone interested in global situational awareness
